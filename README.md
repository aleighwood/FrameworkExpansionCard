# FrameworkExpansionCard

This framework expansion card measures ambient C02 concentration, temperature and humidity. It can be used on any computer with a USBC port. Currently, you can view the sensor readings using your preferred serial interface. In the future I will make a nice UI - any maybe automated high C02 level warnings. 

You will need to install the appropriate drivers for the CP2102 chip. Other ICs included an ATMega328 and Sensirion SCD40.

Unfortunately the size of the Sensirion SCD40 IC prohibits the device from fully fitting into the Framework expansion card bay. In the future I will use the newly released Sensirion STCC4 sensor, allowing the device to fit snugly into the expansion card port.

This is a project that I did under the supervision of Professor Mikhelson at Northwestern University (Chicago).
